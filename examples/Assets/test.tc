Plain text strings are mostly transparent. Leading and ending whitespace are trimmed.

If I want to maximize string flexibility, I open a "long string":
	[" Now I can use ; _ = and [] as often as I please. 
		As well, whitespace is preserved exactly within the markers. "];

A key-value=Hello world!;
My First Sequence=[1;2;3;4;5;6]
Nested sequences=[[a;b;c][e;f;g]]
Null value=_;
Nested key-value stores=[
	Key One=Moo;
	Key Two=[ 1.3; 5.6; 7.8; ["Some string data"] ]
]
13.3=Numeric key;
