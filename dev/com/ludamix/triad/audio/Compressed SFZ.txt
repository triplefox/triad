Description:
    To improve the performance of loading the soundbank over web, the SFZ soundbank 
    is compressed into one binary file. 
    

Compressed SFZ
    A compressed SFZ is a list of SFZ Definition blocks followed by the wave samples
    
    4 Bytes     - The count of definition blocks following  
    # Bytes     - SFZDefinitionBlock01
    # Bytes     - SFZDefinitionBlock02
    4 Bytes     - THe cound of wave blocks following
    # Bytes     - WaveFileBlock01
    # Bytes     - WaveFileBlock02
    # Bytes     - WaveFileBlock03
    ...
    
SFZ Definition Block:
        
    4 Bytes     - String length of upcoming SFZ definition file encoded as integer 
    # Bytes     - The SFZ Definition File as string
    
Wave File Block:
    
    4 Bytes     - String length of upcoming Wave name
    # Bytes     - The name of the wave file
    4 Bytes     - The byte count of the wave file encoded as integer 
    # Bytes     - The bytes of the wave file itself.
